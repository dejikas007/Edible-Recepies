                <h1>DESSERTS</h1>
                <p>
                    Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, such as cake,
                    biscuit,
                    ice cream and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur. <br>
                    Some cultures sweeten foods that are
                    more commonly savory to create desserts. In some parts of the world there is no tradition of a
                    dessert
                    course to conclude a meal.

                </p>
                <p> Here, we are going to look at 3 types of desserts, their ingredients
                    and also how to prepare them.

                <p>
                    How to make Suya Meat Balls
                    My idea of a relaxing weekend is to have well made Suya Meat Balls in a bowl with some tomatoes and
                    raw
                    onion slices . Pairing this with a nice glass of wine and wearing a silk boubou just completes the
                    mood.
                    When you live in Lagos you really understand what it means when someone wishes you a nice weekend.
                    The
                    body just like any engine has to be rested or else you burn out. Talking of rest, I think I want to
                    go
                    back on holiday. I am missing my morning long walks on the street of a suburb in Toronto. I enjoyed
                    the
                    cold morning breeze, the flowers, the bees flying pass,watching people taking out their dogs for a
                    walk,
                    and so many interesting sights.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Now that I am home I simply make do with the gym close by the house to help me stay healthy. There
                    are
                    really not many opportunities to help one increase mobility unless you hit the gym. Anyway for now I
                    will focus on having a nice relaxing weekend .Why not think of something creative to do on your
                    weekend?
                    So let’s go back to my Suya Meat Balls and show you how to make them.

                </div>
                <p>2 cups flour
                    pepper to taste,
                    1¼ cups water,
                    2 tsps yeast,
                    1 tsp ground nutmeg,
                    ½ tsp salt,
                    ¼ cup sugar + 1 tsp for proofing the yeast,
                    ¼ cup vegetable oil for deep frying.</p>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Method for making Puff Puff</h3>

                    <p>Mix half of a cup of warm water, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and the yeast in a cup. Cover and set aside
                        for
                        30 minutes to proof.</p>
                    <p>In another bowl, mix the dry ingredients: the flour, sugar, salt, and nutmeg.
                        Pour the proofed yeast and the remaining one cup of water into the dry ingredients and mix until
                        the
                        batter is lump-free. Add pepper and mix thoroughly.</p>
                    <p> Cover the batter and allow it to rise for 1 hour. When ready for frying, the batter will give
                        off a
                        distinct sweet smell.</p>
                    <p>Preheat the oil in a suitably sized pan. Scoop up a little batter with a spoon and drop into the
                        oil.</p>
                    <p>Fry all over until golden brown. If you are finding it hard to turn the puff puff while frying,
                        just
                        press the balls down a little bit with your spoon and then turn them.</p>
                    <p>Remove from the heat. Drain on paper towel and enjoy while still hot or warm</p>

                    <h3>Method for making Chin Chin</h3>

                   <p> Measure and Mix dry ingredients in a bowl and set aside.<br>
                    Measure and mix wet ingredients together except butter.<br>
                    Add butter to the dry ingredients and mix with your fingers until just combined.</p>
                    
                    <p>Pour in the other wet ingredients and mix together until dough forms. it should form a perfect dough
                        but if its feels a bit stiff, add a tablespoon of water or milk. if it feels too tacky, add a
                        tablespoon or 2 of flour no more. DO NOT over work the dough.</p>
                    <p>Wrap in a saran wrap and allow to rest on the counter for about 5 mins. this allows flavors blend in
                        and develops the gluten which makes it easier during the cutting process</p>
                    <p>Unwrap rested dough, you can roll out all the dough at once since dough is small or you can divide
                        into 2 portions and roll individually. Roll out dough to about a quarter of an inch thick because
                        dough will rise when you fry them.</p>
                    <p> With a knife or pizza cutter or even a dough divider cut dough across vertically and horizontally
                        forming little squares.</p>
                    <p>Put little squares in a bowl and sprinkle a little flour on them and shake to prevent sticking.
                        Heat up oil. Fry till light golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and spread on a paper towel lined
                        tray to cool. Chin chin will be soft when hot but hardens as it cools.</p>
