            <h2>Desserts</h2>
            <p>Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, such as cake, biscuit, ice
                cream and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur. Some cultures sweeten foods that are
                more commonly savory to create desserts. In some parts of the world there is no tradition of a dessert
                course to conclude a meal.</p>
